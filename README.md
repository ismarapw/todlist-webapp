# To-Do-List-Web-App
This To-Do-List website i made in order to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used Local Storage to store all of the tasks, hence we don't need a database. It seems like a simple website, so dont judge me :'D. 

# Instalation and Usage
Just open the HTML file. I dont use any package manager. 

# Features
The features are really simple. At the moment, this website can just add, delete and search task. This to do list website show the statistic of the task that you've done as well. 

# Snapshots
These are some screenshots how the website looks like visually.
