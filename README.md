# To-Do-List-Web-App
This To-Do-List website i made in order to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used Local Storage to store all of the tasks, hence we don't need a database. It seems like a simple website, so dont judge me :'D. 

## Instalation and Usage
Just open the HTML file. I dont use package manager.
